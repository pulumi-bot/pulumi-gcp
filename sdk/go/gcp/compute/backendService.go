	LoadBalancingScheme pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality. The possible values are - ROUND_ROBIN - This is a

	// selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash
	// load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a
	// host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
	// ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to
	// the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load
	// balancer. MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash
	// but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, refer to
