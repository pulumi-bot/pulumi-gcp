        ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
        and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
        ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
        has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
        Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
        - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
          GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
          Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
          project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
