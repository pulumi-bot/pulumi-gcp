    (Optional)
    Contents of the build template. Either a filename or build template must be provided.  Structure is documented below.

      * `images` (`list`) - -
        (Optional)
        A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
        The images are pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
        The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
        If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build status is marked FAILURE.
      * `steps` (`list`) - -
        (Required)
        The operations to be performed on the workspace.  Structure is documented below.
        * `args` (`list`) - -
          (Optional)
          A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
          If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
          are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
          entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
          remainder will be used as arguments.
        * `dir` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Directory, relative to the source root, in which to run the build.
          This must be a relative path. If a step's dir is specified and
          is an absolute path, this value is ignored for that step's
          execution.
        * `entrypoint` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
          default entrypoint.
          If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used
        * `envs` (`list`) - -
          (Optional)
          A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
          running a step.
          The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
          "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
        * `id` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to
          reference this build step as a dependency.
        * `name` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.
        * `secretEnvs` (`list`) - -
          (Optional)
          A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
          a Cloud Key
          Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
          the build's `Secret`.
        * `timeout` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity.
          If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be TIMEOUT.
          This timeout must be equal to or greater than the sum of the timeouts for build steps within the build.
          The expected format is the number of seconds followed by s.
          Default time is ten minutes (600s).
        * `timing` (`str`) - -
          (Optional)
          Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
          build step.
        * `volumes` (`list`) - -
          (Optional)
          List of volumes to mount into the build step.
          Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
          build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
          are discarded.
          Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
          indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.  Structure is documented below.
          * `name` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)
            Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.
          * `path` (`str`) - -
            (Required)
            Path at which to mount the volume.
            Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
            the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

        * `waitFors` (`list`) - -
          (Optional)
          The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
          This build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for`
          have completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step
          will start when all previous build steps in the `Build.Steps` list
          have completed successfully.

      * `tags` (`list`) - -
        (Optional)
        Tags for annotation of a Build. These are not docker tags.
      * `timeout` (`str`) - -
        (Optional)
        Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity.
        If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be TIMEOUT.
        This timeout must be equal to or greater than the sum of the timeouts for build steps within the build.

               Branch and tag names in trigger templates are interpreted as regular
               expressions. Any branch or tag change that matches that regular

               One of `trigger_template` or `github` must be provided.  Structure is documented below.

        The **build** object supports the following:

          * `images` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
            (Optional)
            A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of all build steps.
            The images are pushed using the builder service account's credentials.
            The digests of the pushed images will be stored in the Build resource's results field.
            If any of the images fail to be pushed, the build status is marked FAILURE.
          * `steps` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
            (Required)
            The operations to be performed on the workspace.  Structure is documented below.
            * `args` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Optional)
              A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is started.
              If the image used to run the step's container has an entrypoint, the args
              are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
              entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
              remainder will be used as arguments.
            * `dir` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Directory, relative to the source root, in which to run the build.
              This must be a relative path. If a step's dir is specified and
              is an absolute path, this value is ignored for that step's
              execution.
            * `entrypoint` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Entrypoint to be used instead of the build step image's
              default entrypoint.
              If unset, the image's default entrypoint is used
            * `envs` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Optional)
              A list of environment variable definitions to be used when
              running a step.
              The elements are of the form "KEY=VALUE" for the environment variable
              "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
            * `id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to
              reference this build step as a dependency.
            * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.
            * `secretEnvs` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Optional)
              A list of environment variables which are encrypted using
              a Cloud Key
              Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified in
              the build's `Secret`.
            * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity.
              If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be TIMEOUT.
              This timeout must be equal to or greater than the sum of the timeouts for build steps within the build.
              The expected format is the number of seconds followed by s.
              Default time is ten minutes (600s).
            * `timing` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              Output only. Stores timing information for executing this
              build step.
            * `volumes` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Optional)
              List of volumes to mount into the build step.
              Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to execution of the
              build step. Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents
              are discarded.
              Using a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is
              indicative of a build request with an incorrect configuration.  Structure is documented below.
              * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                Name of the trigger. Must be unique within the project.
              * `path` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Required)
                Path at which to mount the volume.
                Paths must be absolute and cannot conflict with other volume paths on
                the same build step or with certain reserved volume paths.

            * `waitFors` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Optional)
              The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on.
              This build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for`
              have completed successfully. If `wait_for` is empty, this build step
              will start when all previous build steps in the `Build.Steps` list
              have completed successfully.

          * `tags` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
            (Optional)
            Tags for annotation of a Build. These are not docker tags.
          * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Optional)
            Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to second granularity.
            If this amount of time elapses, work on the build will cease and the build status will be TIMEOUT.
            This timeout must be equal to or greater than the sum of the timeouts for build steps within the build.
            The expected format is the number of seconds followed by s.
            Default time is ten minutes (600s).
