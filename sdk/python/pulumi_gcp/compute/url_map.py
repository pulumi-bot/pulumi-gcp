              streams.
              - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
              502, 503 or 504.

              Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
              - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
              REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.

              (Required)
              For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.
              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
              2147483647 inclusive.
              Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,

              (Required)
              For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.

              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
              you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
              future without any impact on existing rules.

                  - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                  any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                  example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                  streams.
                  - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                  502, 503 or 504.
                  - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                  connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                  - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                  REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                  - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to cancelled
                  - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                  gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                  - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable
