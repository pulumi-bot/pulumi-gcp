        The list of path rules. Use this list instead of routeRules when routing based
        on simple path matching is all that's required. The order by which path rules
        are specified does not matter. Matches are always done on the longest-path-first
        basis. For example: a pathRule with a path /a/b/c/* will match before /a/b/*

              (Optional)
              Specfies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies. Valid values are:
              - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
              any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
              example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
              streams.
              - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
              502, 503 or 504.
              - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
              connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
              - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
              Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
              - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
              REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
              - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
              header is set to cancelled
              - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
              gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
              - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
              header is set to resource-exhausted
              - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
              the response header is set to unavailable

          * `timeout` (`dict`) - -
            (Optional)
            Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
            the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the
            response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not
            specified, the default value is 15 seconds.  Structure is documented below.
            * `nanos` (`float`) - -
              (Optional)
              Span of time that's a fraction of a second at nanosecond resolution. Durations

              header is replaced with contents of hostRewrite. The value must be between 1 and
              255 characters.
            * `pathPrefixRewrite` (`str`) - -
              (Optional)
              Prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend service, the matching

            (Optional)
            A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
            occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
            corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
            service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
            number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
            the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header

              Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
              (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
              backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
              been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
              backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.

          advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
          the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
          contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
          weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
          service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
        * `urlRedirect` (`dict`) - -

          When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
          urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be
          set.  Structure is documented below.
          * `hostRedirect` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)

            supplied in the request. The value must be between 1 and 255 characters.
          * `httpsRedirect` (`bool`) - -
            (Optional)
            If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set
            to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that
            of the request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys.

              (Optional)
              Specfies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies. Valid values are:
              - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
              any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
              example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
              streams.
              - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
              502, 503 or 504.
              - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
              connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
              - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
              Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
              - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
              REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
              - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
              header is set to cancelled
              - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
              gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
              - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
              header is set to resource-exhausted
              - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
              the response header is set to unavailable

          * `timeout` (`dict`) - -
            (Optional)
            Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
            the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the

            service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
            number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
            the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header

            * `weight` (`float`) - -
              (Required)
              Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
              (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
              backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
              been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
              backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.

          the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
          contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
          weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
          service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
        * `urlRedirect` (`dict`) - -
          (Optional)
          When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
          urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be
          set.  Structure is documented below.
          * `hostRedirect` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)
            The host that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
            supplied in the request. The value must be between 1 and 255 characters.
          * `httpsRedirect` (`bool`) - -
            (Optional)
            If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set
            to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that
            of the request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys.
            Setting this true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. Defaults to false.
          * `pathRedirect` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)
            The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
            supplied in the request. Only one of pathRedirect or prefixRedirect must be
            specified. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
          * `prefixRedirect` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)

            retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
          * `redirectResponseCode` (`str`) - -
            (Optional)
            The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:   -
            MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.  -
            FOUND, which corresponds to 302.  - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.  -
            TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
            will be retained.  - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
            the request method will be retained.
          * `stripQuery` (`bool`) - -
            (Optional)
            If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed
            prior to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the
            original URL is retained. Defaults to false.

                  - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a

                  - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header

              (Optional)
              The region backend service resource to which traffic is
              directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
              advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
              the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
              contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
              service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
            * `urlRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - -
              (Optional)
              When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by

                (Optional)
                If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set
                to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that
                of the request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys.
                Setting this true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. Defaults to false.
              * `pathRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
                supplied in the request. Only one of pathRedirect or prefixRedirect must be

                The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:   -
                MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.  -
                FOUND, which corresponds to 302.  - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.  -
                TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
                will be retained.  - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
                the request method will be retained.

                (Optional)
                If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed
                prior to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the
                original URL is retained. Defaults to false.

          * `routeRules` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
            (Optional)
            The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
            advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying

            action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
            routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
            External load balancers.  Structure is documented below.

              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.
              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and

                  Specfies one or more conditions when this retry rule applies. Valid values are:
                  - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                  any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                  example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                  streams.
                  - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                  502, 503 or 504.
                  - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                  connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                  - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                  REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                  - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to cancelled
                  - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                  gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                  - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

              * `timeout` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
                the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the
                response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not
                specified, the default value is 15 seconds.  Structure is documented below.
                * `nanos` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - -
                  (Optional)

                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this

                      If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
                      header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
                      were set for that header.

                  * `requestHeadersToRemoves` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
                    (Optional)
                    A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the request

                      (Required)
                      If false, headerValue is appended to any values that already exist for the
                      header. If true, headerValue is set for the header, discarding any values that
                      were set for that header.

                    (Optional)
                    A list of header names for headers that need to be removed from the response
                    prior to sending the response back to the client.

                * `weight` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - -

                  Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
                  (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
                  backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
                  been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
                  backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
                  The value must be between 0 and 1000

            * `service` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
              (Optional)
              The region backend service resource to which traffic is
              directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
              advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
              the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
              contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
              service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
            * `urlRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - -
              (Optional)
              When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
              urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not be

                supplied in the request. The value must be between 1 and 255 characters.
              * `httpsRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - -
                (Optional)
                If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set
                to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that
                of the request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys.
                Setting this true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. Defaults to false.
              * `pathRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
                supplied in the request. Only one of pathRedirect or prefixRedirect must be
                specified. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
              * `prefixRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the HttpRouteRuleMatch,
                retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
              * `redirectResponseCode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:   -
                MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.  -
                FOUND, which corresponds to 302.  - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.  -
                TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
                will be retained.  - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
                the request method will be retained.
              * `stripQuery` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - -
                (Optional)
                If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed
                prior to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the
                original URL is retained. Defaults to false.

        The **tests** object supports the following:

          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Optional)
            An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when

          * `service` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Optional)
            The region backend service resource to which traffic is
            directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
            advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
            the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
            contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
            weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
            service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

            * `priority` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - -
              (Required)
              For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
              in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
              in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
              a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
              that matches the request is applied.
              You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
              Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
              2147483647 inclusive.
              Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
              in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
              1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
              you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
              future without any impact on existing rules.

              actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
              request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
              routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction

                  Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                  - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a

                  - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                  header is set to resource-exhausted
                  - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                  the response header is set to unavailable

              directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
              advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
              the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
              contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
              weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,

                supplied in the request. The value must be between 1 and 255 characters.
              * `httpsRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - -
                (Optional)
                If set to true, the URL scheme in the redirected request is set to https. If set
                to false, the URL scheme of the redirected request will remain the same as that
                of the request. This must only be set for UrlMaps used in TargetHttpProxys.
                Setting this true for TargetHttpsProxy is not permitted. Defaults to false.
              * `pathRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The path that will be used in the redirect response instead of the one that was
                supplied in the request. Only one of pathRedirect or prefixRedirect must be
                specified. The value must be between 1 and 1024 characters.
              * `prefixRedirect` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The prefix that replaces the prefixMatch specified in the HttpRouteRuleMatch,
                retaining the remaining portion of the URL before redirecting the request.
              * `redirectResponseCode` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
                (Optional)
                The HTTP Status code to use for this RedirectAction. Supported values are:   -
                MOVED_PERMANENTLY_DEFAULT, which is the default value and corresponds to 301.  -
                FOUND, which corresponds to 302.  - SEE_OTHER which corresponds to 303.  -
                TEMPORARY_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 307. In this case, the request method
                will be retained.  - PERMANENT_REDIRECT, which corresponds to 308. In this case,
                the request method will be retained.
              * `stripQuery` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - -
                (Optional)
                If set to true, any accompanying query portion of the original URL is removed
                prior to redirecting the request. If set to false, the query portion of the
                original URL is retained. Defaults to false.

        The **tests** object supports the following:

          * `description` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Optional)
            An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
            you create the resource.
          * `host` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Required)
            Host portion of the URL.
          * `path` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Required)
            Path portion of the URL.
          * `service` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - -
            (Optional)
            The region backend service resource to which traffic is
            directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is additionally specified,
            advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending
            the request to the backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
            contain any weightedBackendService s. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any
            weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect,
            service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
