        Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and

              UID is a unique id generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
              allowed to change on PUT operations.

              requests per container of the Revision. Values are:
              - `0` thread-safe, the system should manage the max concurrency. This is
              the default value.
              - `1` not-thread-safe. Single concurrency
              - `2-N` thread-safe, max concurrency of N
            * `containers` (`pulumi.Input[list]`) - -
              (Required)
              Container defines the unit of execution for this Revision.
              In the context of a Revision, we disallow a number of the fields of
              this Container, including: name, ports, and volumeMounts.
              The runtime contract is documented here:

                Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
                environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
                string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a
                double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,
                regardless of whether the variable exists or not.

                When a key exists in multiple sources, the value associated with the last source will
                take precedence. Values defined by an Env with a duplicate key will take

            (Required)
